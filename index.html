          Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Logic, Computation, and Methodology at Carnegie Mellon University. My current research explores how the theory of algorithmic randomness can provide insights into learning under computational constraints. Alongside my research, I am broadly interested in the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of language.

Before starting this PhD, I worked as a systematic strategist at AllianceBernstein and was affliated with Causality in Cognition Lab at Stanford. I received my bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics at UCLA.

Outside of work, I enjoy documentaries, history, and electronic body music. I am trained in Kathak and Hindustani classical music, and I would love to return to formal practice one day.
